Abstract
High school graduation rate is an important metric to measure the success of a school. Despite this, 
little research has been done on the topic, focusing instead on test scores as a measure of student’s 
success. This paper investigates the reasons for the differences seen in graduation rates in public 
high schools across Virginia. Data was collected for each public high school in Virginia on attributes 
of the school as well as attributes of the county. A multiple linear regression was performed to 
create a model for graduation rate as well as student to teacher ratio. Significant predictors were 
found for each. The explanatory variables were able to explain a relatively high percent of the variation 
in the response variables. This study leads to the understanding that factors outside of a student’s 
control are playing too high of a role in influencing their chances of graduating high school.
